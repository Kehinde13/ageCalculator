## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an age in years, months, and days after submitting a valid date through the form
- Receive validation errors if:
- Any field is empty when the form is submitted
- The day number is not between 1-31
- The month number is not between 1-12
- The year is in the future
- The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Bonus: See the age numbers animate to their final number when the form is submitted

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla javavScript

### What I learned
- i learnt how to work with the date object, which was bit tricky at first. but then i understood it after spending some time on it
- i also practised working with form validation 


### Continued development
I plan to keep working with the date object so as to understand it more
